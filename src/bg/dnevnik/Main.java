		It will also be a part of what the simulated users will do.
		They are all according to the website in terms of functionality
		
		The logic for the command management should probably be in the site class,
		it'll likely be here just temporarily
		
		commands:
		"help" shows this info about all commands
		
		"sign up" requires name, email, and password to create a user
		"sign in" requires email and password, allows user to make posts and vote
		"sign out" requires to be signed in, disables ability to make posts and vote
		
		"upvote"/"downvote" requires a post and votes on it
		"comment" requires article and content
		"write article" requires title, content, category, and keywords to create an article
		
		"show all categories" shows all created categories
		"show hot categories" shows the five categories with most articles
		"(category name)" shows all articles in this category 
		(this command should have lower priority over the others, 
		in case a category has the same name as one of the commands)
		"show article" requires an article to show it
		"show comments" requires the last command to have been "show article", 
		and shows them ordered by date, from old to new
		
		These don't require anything, because they use all articles
		"show from today" 
		"sort by new"
		"sort by views"
		"sort by comments"
		"sort by votes"
